Version 1.1

New features:

* QCTOOL now has initial support for VCF files.
* New options for selection of SNPs: -[in|ex]clude-range, -[in|ex]cl-rsids, -[in|ex]cl-snpids, -[in|ex]cl-snps-matching.
	These work as follows: the 'incl' options are combined using a logical OR, the 'excl' options are combined with a logical AND.
	Then the two combined conditions are ANDed.  For example, if you use -excl-rsids <list> -range 01:0-1000000 then 
* New option -condition-on, similar to SNPTEST's -condition_on, adds genotypic dosages to the output sample file.
* New -quantile-normalise option: quantile-normalisation of columns in the sample file.
* New -assume-chromosome option.  If this is used, QCTOOL will fill in missing chromosome values with the given one.
* New: support for multiple cohorts (by specifying -g and/or -s several times.)  SNPs are matched between cohorts using the fields
  specified by -snp-match-fields (which must include position).  Note this only makes sense if all cohorts are aligned to the same
  strand.  If cohorts are aligned to the same strand, but may have differently coded 'A' and 'B' alleles, use -match-alleles-to-cohort1 to
  flip the alleles in all cohorts appropriately.
* New option -match-alleles-to-cohort1.  When several cohorts are specified, QCTOOL will flip alleles between 
* New option -sort, which sorts the output file.  Currently this works with BGEN, unzipped GEN, and unzipped VCF files.

Option changes:
* -snp-excl-list renamed to -excl-rsids / -excl-snpids, similalry for -snp-incl-list.
* -snp-interval replaced with -incl-range / -excl-range
* -snpid-filter replaced with -incl-snps-matching / -excl-snps-matching.

Other changes:

* 
* qctool no longer writes a log file by default: use -log to specify it.
* qctool no longer writes a sample file by default.  Use -os to specify that it should.
* By default, GEN file output contains an extra chromosome column.  Use -omit-chromosome to omit this.
* Breaking change: filters which filter on SNP id fields (IDs, chromosome, position, alleles)
  are now applied before the main qctool processing pipeline.  The practical consequence is that SNP exclusion lists written using
  -write-snp-excl-list do not contain the SNPs in any exclusion lists passed in.
* Do not count lines in GEN or VCF files first (unless they are small).  This speeds up processing of large files.
* Add -omit-chromosome option to omit chromosome information from output GEN-format files.
* File output by -snp-stats has changed format slightly, to remove the first column of numbers.  Load in R with read.table( <filename>, hea=T ).
* Change to the way -snp-stats and -sample-stats options behave.  Each takes the name of a file to output, which must be specified.
* Change to the way -write-sample-excl-list and -write-snp-excl-list behave: now each takes the name of a file to output.
