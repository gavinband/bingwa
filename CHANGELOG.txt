Version 1.1

New features:

* QCTOOL now has initial support for VCF files.
* New/renamed options for selection of SNPs: -[in|ex]clude-range, -[in|ex]cl-rsids, -[in|ex]cl-snpids, -[in|ex]cl-snps-matching.
	These replace -snp-excl-list, -snp-interval, and -snpid-filter.
	These work as follows: the 'incl' options are combined using a logical OR, the 'excl' options are combined with a logical AND.
	Then the two combined conditions are ANDed.  For example, if you use -excl-rsids <list> -range 01:0-1000000 then 
* New option -condition-on, similar to SNPTEST's -condition_on, adds genotypic dosages to the output sample file.
* New -quantile-normalise option: quantile-normalisation of columns in the sample file.
* New -assume-chromosome option.  If this is used, QCTOOL will fill in missing chromosome values with the given one.
* New: support for multiple cohorts (by specifying -g and/or -s several times.)  SNPs are matched between cohorts using the fields
  specified by -snp-match-fields (which must include position).  If cohorts have the same alleles but they may be coded in opposite ways
	(e.g. cohort1 has "T C" and cohort2 has "C T"), use -match-alleles-to-cohort1 to flip the alleles appropriately.
* New option -sort, which sorts the output file.  Currently this works with BGEN, unzipped GEN, and unzipped VCF files.
* QCTOOL now writes a chromosome column in GEN file output by default.  This is understood by recent builds of SNPTEST but possibly not by other
    tools.  To suppress it, use -omit-chromosome.

Bug fixes:
* fix bug where values in screen output are rounded to too low precision.

Other changes:

* -write-snp-excl-list now writes a file that contains SNPID, rsid, chromosome, position, and alleles.
* -write-sample-excl-list now writes a file that contains both Sample IDs.
* qctool no longer writes a log file by default: use -log to specify it.
* qctool no longer writes a sample file by default.  Use -os to specify that it should.
* By default, GEN file output contains an extra chromosome column.  Use -omit-chromosome to omit this.
* Breaking change: filters which filter on SNP id fields (IDs, chromosome, position, alleles)
  are now applied before the main qctool processing pipeline.  The practical consequence is that SNP exclusion lists written using
  -write-snp-excl-list do not contain the SNPs in any exclusion lists passed in.
* Do not count lines in GEN or VCF files first (unless they are small).  This speeds up processing of large files.
* Add -omit-chromosome option to omit chromosome information from output GEN-format files.
* File output by -snp-stats has changed format slightly, to remove the first column of numbers.  Load in R with read.table( <filename>, hea=T ).
* Change to the way -snp-stats and -sample-stats options behave.  Each takes the name of a file to output, which must be specified.
* Change to the way -write-sample-excl-list and -write-snp-excl-list behave: now each takes the name of a file to output.
