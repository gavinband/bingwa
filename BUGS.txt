Known bugs for qc-tool
======================
Fixed?		Description:
------		------------
*			-snp-stats output: alleles represent two columns so should have seperate 'allele_A' and 'allele_B' column headers.
			(otherwise R can't read it easily).

*			Only round genotype probabilities where needed (just for HWE I think).

*			Sample file: incorrect samples output when filtering.

*			Due to change in GenRow implementations, need to reset genrow number of samples
			before reading each row.

*			Crash when running file with lots of missing data.  Happens in SNPHWE.cpp
			FIX: SNPHWE.hpp: catch case where all observed counts are 0.  Return probability of 1 in this case.

*			SNP missing data rates can get reported that are greater than 1.0 i.e. 1.0408 
			FIX: in SimpleGenotypeAssayStatistics.cpp: divide by number of samples, not genotype amount sum.

*			Bug: currently it's possible to pass in a non-gen file to a --g option (I guess this is in GenFileSNPDataSource).
			It seems to conclude it's a file with 0 snps in.  Make an error for this.
