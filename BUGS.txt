Known bugs for qc-tool
======================
Fixed?		Description:
------		------------
			-snp-stats output: alleles represent two columns so should have seperate 'allele_A' and 'allele_B' column headers.
			(otherwise R can't read it easily).

			Only round genotype probabilities where needed (just for HWE I think).

			Sample file: incorrect samples output when filtering.

*			Due to change in GenRow implementations, need to reset genrow number of samples
			before reading each row.

*			Crash when running file with lots of missing data.  Happens in SNPHWE.cpp
			FIX: SNPHWE.hpp: catch case where all observed counts are 0.  Return probability of 1 in this case.

*			SNP missing data rates can get reported that are greater than 1.0 i.e. 1.0408 
			FIX: in SimpleGenotypeAssayStatistics.cpp: divide by number of samples, not genotype amount sum.

*			Bug: currently it's possible to pass in a non-gen file to a --g option (I guess this is in GenFileSNPDataSource).
			It seems to conclude it's a file with 0 snps in.  Make an error for this.

Non-bugs / misfeatures for qc-tool
==================================

Misfeature
----------

You can filter on any sample file, even if it has dodgy missing or heterozygosity values
Using -heterozygosity leads to assert if heterozygosity field doesn't appear in sample file.

Below is Jonathan's suggestion:

we have one option

-calc-stats file

which basically runs

-snp-stats file.snpstats -sample-stats file.samplestats

AND overwrites the input sample file with the missing and heterozygosity rates. The stats files can then be examined by the user and filter options decided upon.

You could make it so that this option cannot be run with any of the filters so then you have the filter options as a second step.

I think you should also not allow people to specify output files when running -calc-stats.
