Known bugs for qc-tool
======================
Fixed?		Description:
------		------------
			-snp-stats output: alleles represent two columns so should have seperate 'allele_A' and 'allele_B' column headers.
			(otherwise R can't read it easily).

			Sample file: incorrect samples output when filtering.

*			Crash when running file with lots of missing data.  Happens in SNPHWE.cpp
			FIX: SNPHWE.hpp: catch case where all observed counts are 0.  Return probability of 1 in this case.
			
			SNP missing data rates can get reported that are greater than 1.0 i.e. 1.0408
