gen-select TODO LIST 29/06/2009

Done?	Description
-----   -----------
*		Restrict file wildcard to numbers between 1 and 100 only.
*		Implement sample file writer.
		Implement check that full set of chromosome files has been supplied for --sample-stats option.
		Protect against overwriting input files?
*		OptionProcessor: support more than on use of the same option: "-g example/1.gen -g example/2.gen"
*		OptionProcessor: support multiple values for one option: "-snp-interval 0 1000"
*		OptionProcessor: support option dependencies and exclusivities.
*		Add option definitions as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
		(Make all those options work.)
		(Delete now unused options.)
*		Statistic naming as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
		Implement -sample-excl-list and -sample-incl-list
		Implement -sample-missing-rate and -sample-heterozygosity.
*		Fix end-of-file bug (rearrange so input operations return the stream, which we then test.)
*		Fix bug where passing non-gen file causes program to hang.
*		Rationalise ObjectSource / ObjectSink nonsense.
*		Output stats in the same order given.
		Support overwriting sample file (with warning and pause?)
