Done?	Description
-----   -----------
		qc-tool: fix static build.  Here is the command line I used on linux:
g++ -o build/release/qc-tool-static src/*.cpp genfile/src/*.cpp statfile/src/*.cpp ../usr/lib/libboost_iostreams-gcc43-mt-1_39.a ../usr/lib/libboost_filesystem-gcc43-mt-1_39.a /usr/lib/libz.a -static-libgcc -static -I include/ -I genfile/include/ -I statfile/include/ -I ../usr/include/boost-1_39/ /usr/lib/libz.a -I build/release/statfile/ -DHAVE_ZLIB=1 -DHAVE_BOOST=1 -DHAVE_BOOST_FILESYSTEM=1 -I build/release/genfile/include/ apps/qc-tool.cpp ../usr/lib/libboost_system-gcc43-mt-1_39.a
		For some reason my attempts using waf don't work, perhaps because htere's a trailing 'Wl,-Bdynamic'

		qc-tool: Don't backup big files.
		qc-tool: Make output GEN file have same format as input GEN file unless specified.
*		qc-tool: Support multiple files for snp-incl-list and/or snp-excl-list.
		qc-tool: Implement full check that full set of chromosome files has been supplied for --sample-stats option.
		genfile: port range-based probability setters as in impute branch.
		OptionProcessor: format option descriptions with line-wrapping.
		OptionProcessor: Fully support positional options.
*		qc-tool: Send screen output to a log file.
*		qc-tool: Create post-processing information block.
*		qc-tool: Verify input sample file has needed statistics.
*		qc-tool: Don't allow filtering and sample file writing at the same time.
*		qc-tool: Support overwriting sample file with warning.
*		qc-tool: Make files come in numerical order if wildcard is used, a la gen-compare.
*		OptionProcessor: options should be grouped for display purposes.
*		OptionProcessor: format option descriptions better.
*		gen-compare: Make files come in numerical order if wildcard is used.

-----   -----------

*		Rationalise unholy SNPDataSource / ObjectSource alliance.

gen-select TODO LIST 29/06/2009

Done?	Description
-----   -----------
*		Restrict file wildcard to numbers between 1 and 100 only.
*		Implement sample file writer.
*		Implement simple check that full set of chromosome files has been supplied for --sample-stats option.
*		Protect against overwriting input files?
*		OptionProcessor: support more than on use of the same option: "-g example/1.gen -g example/2.gen"
*		OptionProcessor: support multiple values for one option: "-snp-interval 0 1000"
*		OptionProcessor: support option dependencies and exclusivities.
*		Add option definitions as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
*		(Make all those options work.)
*		(Delete now unused options.)
*		Statistic naming as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
*		Implement -sample-excl-list and -sample-incl-list
*		Implement -sample-missing-rate and -sample-heterozygosity.
*		Fix end-of-file bug (rearrange so input operations return the stream, which we then test.)
*		Fix bug where passing non-gen file causes program to hang.
*		Rationalise ObjectSource / ObjectSink nonsense.
*		Output stats in the same order given.
*		Perform basic checks, supporting warnings and errors
*		Better-formatted preamble.
