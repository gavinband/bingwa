gen-tools TODO LIST 27/07/2009

Done?	Description
-----   -----------
		Use of boost::function in read_snp() does lead to a performance decrease for bgen files.
			This should improve if probability getters can be called fewer times, e.g. with a range
			of values.  Do this!

		Currently it's possible to pass in a non-gen file to a --g option (I guess this is in GenFileSNPDataSource).
		It seems to conclude it's a file with 0 snps in.  Make an error for this.

*		Rationalise unholy SNPDataSource / ObjectSource alliance.

gen-select TODO LIST 29/06/2009

Done?	Description
-----   -----------
*		Restrict file wildcard to numbers between 1 and 100 only.
*		Implement sample file writer.
*		Implement simple check that full set of chromosome files has been supplied for --sample-stats option.
*		Protect against overwriting input files?
*		OptionProcessor: support more than on use of the same option: "-g example/1.gen -g example/2.gen"
*		OptionProcessor: support multiple values for one option: "-snp-interval 0 1000"
*		OptionProcessor: support option dependencies and exclusivities.
*		Add option definitions as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
*		(Make all those options work.)
*		(Delete now unused options.)
*		Statistic naming as per whiteboard 26/06/09 (see iPhoto).
*		Implement -sample-excl-list and -sample-incl-list
*		Implement -sample-missing-rate and -sample-heterozygosity.
*		Fix end-of-file bug (rearrange so input operations return the stream, which we then test.)
*		Fix bug where passing non-gen file causes program to hang.
*		Rationalise ObjectSource / ObjectSink nonsense.
*		Output stats in the same order given.
*		Perform basic checks, supporting warnings and errors
*		Better-formatted preamble.
