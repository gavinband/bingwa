bingwa is a package for frequentist and bayesian meta-analysis of GWAS.
See the website <http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bingwa> for more details.

## COMPILATION

Compilation involves two steps: configuration and build.
To configure the package, from the top-level directory run
> ./waf-1.5.18 configure
To build the package, run
> ./waf-1.5.18

Then main bingwa executable can be found under build/release/.  For debugging purposes, a debug build is also built under build/default/.
